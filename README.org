* Tabby
** About
Ever wanted a pet in your tab bar?  Well, with the power of SVGs and tab-bar-mode magic, now you can!
Choose from a variety of pets including:
- cat
- dog
- robot

This package requires Emacs 28 or higher, for the tab-bar-mode.

In the future, there will be more pets added, but adding your own pet is also easy!
Please see [[file:tabby.el][tabby-cat.el]] for an example of how to make a pet.


** Inspiration
This package aims to replicate the "Corgi Mode" from Google Colab:

These Corgis trot across the top bar. The closest, editable analogue of this is Emacs' tab bar.

I also noticed other 

I really wanted pets in Emacs.

** How it Works
IDK if I will get this project to work. For now it is just an experiment.
My basic plan is to:
1. Get SVG's working.
2. Position SVG's properly
3. Create SVG sprites and make some type of modular sprite system
4. Create sprites for cat, dog, and robot
5. Add clickable actions to the pets (such as sitting or feeding!)
